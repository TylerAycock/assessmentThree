        <h1>Cardiff By the Sea  </h1>
        <p>Welcome to one of the most scenic neighborhoods in all of San Diego. Tucked between Del Mar and Encinitas, this small beach town is where I am lucky enough to call home. <br><br> A stones throw from the beach we have amazing ocean views. In addition we have a variety of local resuarants. I've listed a few of my favorites below. Having trouble picking which spot to visit first? Just click the button and let me decide!</p>
        <h2>The Shanty</h2>
        <p>A locals favorite, this simple dive bar has plenty of cold beer and cheap bites</p>
        <h2>Best Pizza</h2>
        <p>Like the name suggests, they definitely have the best pizza in town!</p>
        <h2>The Sicilian</h2>
        <p>A great date night spot, with fantastic pasta dishes</p>
        <h2>Seaside Market</h2>
        <p>Our local grocery store that has amazing and cost effective premade meals. Great for grab n go before you hit the beach</p>
        <h2>Fish 101</h2>
        <p>Local purveyor of all things fish. I'd highly recommend the tacos</p>
